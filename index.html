        <p id="brand">I am an addicted problem solver, enthusiastic about the creative process and the actualization of client dreams. I seek out each challenge with relish and thrive on the development process to bring a project from idea to completion. I take a holistic approach to my work and strive to be a strong link in the team dynamic.</p>

        <p>I'm still finding my place within the world of programming and code, but I have an affinity for backend work and working with the transfer of data from the backend structure to the frontend framework.</p>
        <p>The project I most enjoyed working on thus far was a MEAN stack App for Magic: The Gathering. A classmate and I built a <a href="https://magicdeckbuilder.herokuapp.com/">deck builder</a>. It was an exciting project as I got to focus on setting up and maintaining a good clean database and server and figuring out how to serve all our data to our Angular.js framework we were using. It was challenging at times. One challenge was deciding when I should be calling up information from the Json file we had recieved from the Magic: The Gathering Database through an API AJAX request and when to use the information stored in our database and when to switch between the two.</p>

        <p>Two other frameworks that interest me are Ruby on Rails and Wordpress. I plan to experiment heavily with these frameworks once I have completed the WDI course on Aug. 16.</p>

        <h5 class="projectdesc">Project Description</h3>
        <p>A team project betweem myself and a classmate named James Goatcher. This project is a MEANstack app and was written using Angular.JS for its front-end appearance, Express.js for its server framework, MongoDB as a database, and within Node.js's runtime environment. It was styled with love using vanilla CSS. My main duties as a team member were focused on the Angular and Express files for this project. I developed the Mongoose framework in Express for our MongoDB database as well as the general framework and a great deal of the functionality of the angular file. I assissted James with the HTML pages as well, but my focus during the project was the Database and Angular funcitonality. I left the styling and visual structure as well as much of the content of the site to James.</p>

        <h5 class="projectdesc">Project Description</h3>
        <p>A simple display of a MEANstack app. MongoDB is employed as the Database and Express is used as the server. Angular is used to make this a single page app and Node holds everything together. This project is intended to be integrated with Google Oauth sign in and then Google calendar, but due to technical difficulties during the project time I was allotted to get this and the Hearthstone app done, I was forced to scrap those ideas and streamline the app to acheive basic functionality. I hope that in the coming months I can get the app working with Google's APIs.</p>

        <h5 class="projectdesc">Project Description</h3>
        <p>A simple idea to make another deck builder, but this time for Hearthstone by Blizzard. Unfortunately Blizzard has yet to release an official API for Hearthstone so for the time being I am using a third party API. This has lead to issues with the reliabilty of the search functionality within my app as it relies upon the API's database to be working correctly and that has been an occasional problem. This app is built in Ruby on Rails.</p>
